# logseq-plugin-jump-to-block

[Logseq](https://logseq.com/) plugin that mimics the [Go to symbol](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-symbol) functionality (known from Visual Studio Code).

It lets you fuzzy search the 'table of contents' of the current page and scroll to the selected block. If the any parent blocks of the selected block are collapsed, they will be expanded.

---

Execute the `Jump to blockâ€¦` command via the command palette, or via keyboard shortcut (default: `mod-t`).
